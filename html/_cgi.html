                CGI Group Inc. is a Canadian multinational information technology (IT) consulting, systems integration, outsourcing, and solutions company headquartered in Montreal, Canada. 
                CGI stands for <font class="italics">Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique</font> in French, which translates to "Information Systems and Management Consultants", in English. However, the official English meaning is "Consultants to Government and Industry". 
                CGI was founded in 1976 by Serge Godin, Andr&eacute Imbeau, and Jean Brassard. In August 2012, CGI acquired the British IT services company Logica for $2.8 billion, making it the sixth-largest IT services provider in the world.(Wikipedia)<br>
