        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>315. Programming Studio</i></dt>
            <dd>This course is intended as an intensive programming experience that integrates core concepts in Computer Science and familiarizes students with a variety of programming/development tools and techniques. Students primarily work in small teams on month-long projects emphasizing differenc specializations within computer science.The courses focuses on honning good programming techniques to ease code integration, reuse, and clarity.</dd>
        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>313. Intro to Computer Systems</i></dt>
            <dd>This class is covers common algorithmic and implementation problems arising in operating systems, inter-process communication, multi-threading, synchronization, memory management,process scheduling, and large-scale file I/O.</dd>
        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>113. Intermediate Programming & Design</i></dt> 
            <dd>This course provides students with knowledge of a computer program structure, design, development/implementation and testing. In addttion, this course provides knowledge of object-oriented and generic programming concepts: objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, classes, algorithms, and type-independent algorithms. This course also touches on standard libraries.</dd> 
        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>221. Data Structures and Algorithms</i></dt> 
            <dd>This course covers the specification, analysis and implementation of abstract data types for lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and their associated algorithms. Performance trade-offs of different implementations; asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage. Includes the execution of students programs written in C++; emphasis on adherence to good software engineering principles.</dd> 
        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>222. Discrete Structures for Computing</i></dt> 
            <dd>Provide mathematical foundations from discrete mathematics for analyzing computer algorithms, for both correctness and performance; Introduction to models of computation, including finite state machines and Turing machines.</dd> 
        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>310. Database Systems</i></dt> 
            <dd>This course introduces various topics in database systems and applications, including file structures, access methods, database modeling, design, user interface, components of database management systems, information storage and retrieval, query languages, and high-level language interface with database systems.</dd> 
        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>350. Computer Architecture and Design</i></dt> 
            <dd>
                This course serves as an introduction to computer organization and architecture. 
                It examines in-depth the inner-workings of modern digital computer systems and the tradeoffs present at the hardware-software interface. 
                It provides insights in the design process of complex hardware systems. 
                A digital design background is considered fundamental and is mandatory. 
                This course includes a significant design component based on Hardware-Description Language modeling and simulation of a non-trivial RISC processor.

        <dt class="courseTitle"><i>481. Seminar</i></dt>
            <dd>The goal of this course is to expose students to a variety of topics of current interest in computer science.  
                This will particularly focus on practical issues related to career-oriented topics, such as finding a job, job environment, and graduate school. 
                Presentations about these topics will involve a variety of invited speakers in a seminar environment.
