                    <br>Camp Quest Texas is an annual week long Summer Camp with the goal of giving children both a fun and educational experience, allowing campers to grow into themselves.
                    The camp hosts philosophical discussions and encourages campers to continuously ask questions while formulating their own opinions. 
                    &quot;Our Summer Camp teaches campers how to think, not what to think&quot;

                    <br> I worked as a vlounteer as what will come to be one my favorite summer memories.

                <dd>
                    <br> I assisted in supervising of a group of 80 kids, ages 7&ndash;16.<br>
                    Although certain volunteers were assigned to specific cabin I was a &quot;floating&quot; volunteer,
                    which means that I got to spend time running around with every group of kids having a blast,

                <dd>
                    <br> One of my favorite memories from camp was telling stories about pigs who are pilots, cats who are kings, and panda's that learned lessons about friendship to the littlest boys cabin at after &quot;lights out&quot;.

                <dd>
                    <br> I also taught Basic scientific principles such as the scientific method to classes of 20 kids at a time.           
                    These classes were on simple science experiments that they could recreate at home. 
                    One of the experiments involved making &quot;slime&quot; from Elmer&acute;s glue and Borax, and discussing polymers and why this type of reaction occurred.
