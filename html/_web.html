                    The goal of this course is to teach students to be able to plot complex transfer functions using node approximations and be able to develop small signal (linear) models for soft non-linear circuits. 
                    To study circuits based on operational amplifiers, diodes, bipolar devices and MOS field effect transistors. To be able to recognize the importance and roll of dc and ac signals on the amplifiers. 
                    To analyze, design, simulate basic configurations of electronic circuits. 
                    To get practical experience on the use of these devices and topologies, students will build some circuits in the lab and use the SPICE simulator to verify functionally and robustness of the design.

            <dt class="courseTitle"><i>314. Signals and Systems</i></dt>
                <dd>This course covers fundamental concepts regarding continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems, as well as time domain characterization of linear time-invariant(LTI) systems, Fourier analysis, filtering,  sampling, and modulation techniques for communication systems. </dd>
            <dt class="courseTitle"><i>214. Electrical Circuit Theory</i></dt>
                <dd>This course covers: resistive circuits, circuit laws, network reduction, nodal analysis, energy storage elements, sinusoidal steady state, AC energy systems, magnetically coupled circuits, the ideal transformer, resonance, and an introduction to computer applications in circuit analysis.</dd> 
            <dt class="courseTitle"><i>248. Introduction to Digital Systems Design</i></dt> 
                <dd>This course is covers working knowledge of different methods for logic representation, manipulation, and optimization for both combinational and sequential logic. 
                    At the end of the course students are able to view the design of digital systems from a new perspective and have an understanding of several fundamental concepts that can be applied to a wide variety of digital design problems.
